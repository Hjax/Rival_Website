Due to the way twitch handles redirects post login, this folder needs to be put in C:\inetpub\wwwroot and run through IIS / localhost in order to function properly. If there's any issues let me know.

Once this is running off a box somewhere on the web there will be some configuration on twitch for our particular application to ensure it functions correctly.
